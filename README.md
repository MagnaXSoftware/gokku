# Gokku

Gokku is a small command line client for dokku or other similar.

The Gokku client simplifies issuing commands to control the Dokku server by wrapping the communication to the server within the application. This enhances the user experience for the developer, as they won't have to wrangle SSH commands, but can instead issue simple gokku commands, but instead use gokku and let it convert local commands into ssh calls.
