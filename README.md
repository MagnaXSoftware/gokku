# Gokku

Gokku is a small docker-powered PaaS with a matching command line client.

## Client

The Gokku client simplifies issuing commands to control the Gokku server by wrapping the communication to the server within the application. This allows for faster and better iterations, which leads to quicker deploys to production.

The Gokku client is also compatible with the dokku PaaS, adding goodness to its offering.

## Server

The Gokku server is currently a WIP.
